The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies.

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250513214200 +0000" stop="20250513224200 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250513224200 +0000" stop="20250513234200 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Sketch tackles Nick's measuring stick, while Glen helps heathen Bob get an honor inking.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250513234200 +0000" stop="20250514004200 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Jay tackles Mark's Greek tragedy, while Alice helps Lois to celebrate her penguin persona.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250514004200 +0000" stop="20250514014100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Alice covers Tara's kid-like crayon; Glen rids Alex of his hero worship howler and Jay suffers a little beard envy.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250514014100 +0000" stop="20250514024000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Jay gives Leuan a tribute to his late sister; Mike wants to evict the eye on his thigh and Glen gets hands on with Ben's big boy.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250514024000 +0000" stop="20250514034000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Sketch de-thrones Dan, the self-proclaimed king; Alice cooks up a treat for ex chef Melody and Jay helps Az make a wise choice.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250514034000 +0000" stop="20250514043200 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay visits a “Caribbean” style resort hotel in Fort Pierce, Florida where the young inexperienced owner, Brian is making guests’ time at the hotel miserable with filthy rooms, late night concerts and shocking service.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250514043200 +0000" stop="20250514052300 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Island Park, Idaho to try and rescue the failing Angler’s Lodge.

For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250514214700 +0000" stop="20250514224700 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Glen devours Harri's fast food foul-up, while Sketch
