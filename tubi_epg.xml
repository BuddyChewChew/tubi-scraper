bought undone by a seemingly simple obstacle on the Qualifier, the Slippery Stairs. It’s all in the name really, an innocent set of stairs, covered in Wipeout Crash cream. Its up the way and down the way for all and sundry. The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris. It’s a colourful week with leotards, laughs and lots of ladies.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250502104928 +0000" stop="20250502120252 +0000"><title>Total

Soon after, he hears the sound of the hunt begin and the unforgettable noise of the horses and hounds in hot pursuit of the fox.  Running for cover, towards the safety of his home-made shelter, he stumbles and falls into a pit - screaming. LIZA, isolated in the disused railway carriage which constitutes her home, moves deeper into the wood having heard the scream.  She finds the pit and sees the tramp lying crumpled on the ground, clearly dead.  She stares at him for a moment, then turns and walks away.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250503170500 +0000" stop="20250503185200 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>After a local photographer wins an urban myth competition with his creation of The Wolf Hunter, it unexpectedly gains a cult following.
