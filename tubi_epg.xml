Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in "fine dining", he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart. Ramsay soon had the restaurant chocker block but what state is it in now?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250505030000 +0000" stop="20250505040000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Saturday night at The Glass House Restaurant in Ambleside was a disaster.  Orders in the kitchen were mixed up, the food wasn't cooked properly and the customers were complaining.  Not only was the chef in tears, but the owners were on the brink of bankruptcy.   

A few months on, there have been some departures from the Glass House. Who is in charge of the kitchen now? And, more importantly, is Ramsay's Caesar salad still on the menu?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250505040000 +0000" stop="20250505050000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S03:E05 - The F Word</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250505050000 +0000" stop="20250505060000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S03:E06 - The F Word</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250505060000 +0000" stop="20250505070000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250505070000 +0000" stop="20250505080000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Nick and Richard are self-confessed restaurant virgins.  They've both had successful careers in the brewery business so when they bought Moore Place they believed they could make it an instant success.  What they hadn't realized was just how difficult it would be to fill the 90-seater oak-paneled restaurant and how hard it would be to find a chef who could cook decent food.

Has Ramsay's fast-track guide to restaurant success helped these brewery whiz-kids transform their failing ex-Berni Inn into a profitable business?

La Gondola is stuck in a time-warp with naff Seventies cuisine, bad net curtains and no customers. New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal.

The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own
