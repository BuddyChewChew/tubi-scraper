Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250421030000 +0000" stop="20250421033000 +0000"><title>ABC World News Tonight With David Muir</title><desc>The latest news from America, as reported by the ABC television network.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250421033000 +0000" stop="20250421040000 +0000"><title>ABC World News Tonight With David Muir</title><desc>The latest news from America, as reported by the ABC television network.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250421040000 +0000" stop="20250421060000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250421060000 +0000" stop="20250421063000 +0000"><title>ABC World News Now</title><desc>Up-to-date information on current events and news from around the world, airing in the overnight hours.

Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421024700 +0000" stop="20250421034300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Norwich City FC supporter Scott and space-loving Dan both took their passions too far with terrible tattoos; Sketch tackles a cover to help transgender Jai feel more feminine.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421034300 +0000" stop="20250421044000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>The guys receive a visit from Emma, who disguises her tattoo equations after an attempt to impress her math teacher; Alice gets her claws into dog-lover William's cover.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421044000 +0000" stop="20250421053600 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Sketch helps Sian cover a clown tattoo that's scaring the life out of anyone who sees it; Jay has to deal with Emma's extremely intimate cat portrait.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421053600 +0000" stop="20250421063000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Harry wants a memorial tattoo dedicated to a very intimate body part after surviving testicular cancer; Matt has doodled on his own legs with a tattoo machine.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421063000 +0000" stop="20250421072500 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>The artists cover Zoe's tattoo dedicated to her favourite food, Sean's lewd and lengthy leprechaun that his wife wants rid of.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421072500 +0000" stop="20250421082500 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Jay saves Luke's bacon with a polished portrait; Sketch beautifies Mark's belly Buddha.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421082500 +0000" stop="20250421092300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Alice tackles Beverley's backside blunder; Jay wipes Bailey's holiday Poomoji tatt clean.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421092300 +0000" stop="20250421102300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>John's tattoo is on another planet, while Alec has made a big mistake with a tiny inking.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421102300 +0000" stop="20250421112300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Jay gives Ian a portrait that has to be seen to be believed and Alice covers Linsey's scar.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421112300 +0000" stop="20250421122100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Belieber Nathan decides it's time for Sketch to rid him of his embarrassing fan tattoo.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421122100 +0000" stop="20250421132100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Sketch meets Billy, whose habit of tattooing himself to impress ladies has got out of hand.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421132100 +0000" stop="20250421141700 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>Skillett's death further troubles the situation in Skeetsmoor Estate.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421141700 +0000" stop="20250421151300 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>Drug dealers complicate the search for a bail-jumper.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421151300 +0000" stop="20250421160900 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>A psychiatrist questions Danny about the Skillett case.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421160900 +0000" stop="20250421170500 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>Fly along with helicopter doctors and paramedics of the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, where cutting-edge modern emergency medicine saves lives every day.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421170500 +0000" stop="20250421180100 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>Fly along with helicopter doctors and paramedics of the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, where cutting-edge modern emergency medicine saves lives every day.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421180100 +0000" stop="20250421185700 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>Fly along with helicopter doctors and paramedics of the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, where cutting-edge modern emergency medicine saves lives every day.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421185700 +0000" stop="20250421195800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's first programme is La Lanterna in Letchworth, Hertfordshire.

It is the prime example of HOW NOT TO RUN A RESTAURANT. Owner DAVE is the flakey self-appointed head chef, who hasn't been in a kitchen for 30 years and can't cook. His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from "tomato and cointreau soup" to "pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce".

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250422205700 +0000" stop="20250422215800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's program Gordon Ramsay travels to the seaside to help ailing hotel and restaurant, The Sandgate.

New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250422225900 +0000" stop="20250423000000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Gordon last left Laurence knowing that he had simplified his menu to have clean, simple, honest, traditional food using local produce.

Lured by the easy wealth of the narcotics industry, crooked cops began breaking the laws they were sworn to uphold. They would stop at nothing, including murder, to protect their rackets. When it became clear they could no longer police themselves, the FBI got involved. Putting their lives on the line, undercover agents devised a way to flush out the violent cops and restore trust in the city's police force.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250422104300 +0000" stop="20250422114100 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In rural Texas, 13-year-old is kidnapped on her way to school.
