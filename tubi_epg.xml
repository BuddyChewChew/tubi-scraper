baggage." How much is acceptable among three contestants in each episode is determined by the "dater," who hears the candidates' intimate secrets and hidden flaws, as well as their attempts to deflect these traits by describing their positive attributes. After two elimination rounds leave one remaining contestant, it's the dater's turn to reveal his or her own baggage ... and then the contestant decides to go forward with the date or not.

As a result, Yami Marik becomes angered, and attacks Odion with the Millennium Rod, which weakens Odion even more. Odion doesn't give up, despite Ishizu's protests. As Marik continues his onslaught (which begins to injure Odion), Odion tells Marik's good side that together, they had conquered his evil half before, and that they could do it again. Then, he tells the good Marik that since Yami Marik was created by the good Marik's hatred, he has the power to destroy him. As Yami Marik raises the Rod to deliver the final blow, the good Marik disappears from the field, and begins fighting against Yami Marik, who struggles for control over Marik's body, and refuses to be defeated. However, Marik's good half stalls Yami Marik long enough for Yugi to activate his spell card. Yugi's Ragnarok spell succeeds in destroying (and removing to the graveyard) Ra, allowing the good Marik to regain control of his body. However, a sliver of Yami Marik reappears on the field, although this time, he is the victim. Yami Marik tries to convince the good Marik to help him seize the Millennium Items and rule the world together, but fails as Marik has decided to stop being evil and make up for his actions. Marik surrenders the duel to Yugi, which sends Yami Marik to the Shadow Realm, ending the Battle City finals. Bakura and Mai are returned from the shadow realm and Marik is reunited with his siblings, who forgive him. Yugi receives the three Egyptian God Cards. Kaiba then activates the Duel Tower's self-destruct sequence, giving everybody one hour to get off the island before it explodes.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20250501153000 +0000" stop="20250501160000 +0000"><title>Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</title><desc>Yusei, Jack and Crow face off against Goodwin in the ultimate Shadow Duel showdown.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20250501160000 +0000" stop="20250501163000 +0000"><title>Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</title><desc>With the safety of the world hanging in the balance, Yusei, Jack and Crow look to tip the scales in their favor by setting their sights on Goodwin's Earthbound Immortal.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20250501163000 +0000" stop="20250501170000 +0000"><title>Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</title><desc>With his life points running on empty, Yusei looks to rev it up one last time in order to defeat Goodwin and save the world from the destructive powers of the King of the Netherworld!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20250501170000 +0000" stop="20250501173000 +0000"><title>Talking Tom and Friends</title><desc>Talking Tom’s coolness is threatened when an old friend turns from dweeb to trendsetter.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20250501173000 +0000" stop="20250501174527 +0000"><title>Talking Tom and Friends</title><desc>Talking Tom is forced to gobble down evidence of Talking Angela’s criminal activity.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20250501174527 +0000" stop="20250501180000 +0000"><title>Talking Tom and Friends</title><desc>Talking Hank puts his ninja skills to the test as he teaches Talking Ginger the art of combat.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20250501180000 +0000" stop="20250501183000 +0000"><title>Talking Tom and Friends</title><desc>Talking Tom wastes too much time online choosing hashtags over heart-to-hearts.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20250501183000 +0000" stop="20250501190000 +0000"><title>Angry Birds</title><desc>Fun adventure episodes from Angry Birds, Piggy Tales and Stella!

As always the adventure will end with a feast, right back in Chintan’s kitchen.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250502153028 +0000" stop="20250502160043 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>Hop in the float plane—a new episode of DIRT just dropped.

The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250501211600 +0000" stop="20250501221600 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point.

Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250501221600 +0000" stop="20250501231600 +0000"><title>Gordon Behind Bars</title><desc>He arrives at Brixton Prison in south London packed with drug dealers, burglars, muggers and thieves - some very unsavoury characters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250501231600 +0000" stop="20250502001600 +0000"><title>Gordon Behind Bars</title><desc>Gordon has chosen his Bad Boys Brigade to work for his prison business, and now he has to trust the prisoners with sharp knives if they're to be able to cook on the inside and sell on the outside.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250502001600 +0000" stop="20250502011600 +0000"><title>Gordon Behind Bars</title><desc>Gordon invites players from the coffee shop industry are to the prison to try some of the food.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250502011600 +0000" stop="20250502021600 +0000"><title>Gordon Behind Bars</title><desc>Gordon's served almost six months in Brixton Prison, but it will mean nothing if he doesn't leave a viable business behind to keep prisoners working and earning.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250502021600 +0000" stop="20250502031600 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Pash mops up a ghastly gravy gaffe;
