Lucky for us, they even stopped by Huckberry’s own backyard in Austin for a quick ruck and a couple games of chicken sh*t bingo. When the dust finally settled, we fired up the barbecue for our beefiest feast yet and raised our ranch waters high to 10 DIRT episodes in the can.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250518044942 +0000" stop="20250518053006 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>For DIRT’s first trip across the pond, host Josh Rosen dove head first into Ireland.

To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains.

Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250519010600 +0000" stop="20250519020700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's second programme is D-Place in Chelmsford, Essex run by Mexican-born Israel and his English partner Tara.

Shortly before leaving their hotel they mention they haven't been able to find what they're looking for; "something old and derelict that they can do up." Anne Merrick tells them about Winyard, a tumbledown cottage in the woods, might be for sale. At the estate agents they are told the house is not yet available for viewing. Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter. The next morning they are found strangled in their own car. DCI Barnaby starts the investigation with the help of PC Ben Jones and they come across the world of estate agents, identical twins, ghosts, piano wire, and more before another body turns up.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250518080000 +0000" stop="20250518100000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Villagers of Midsomer Barton are all set to celebrate Oak Apple Week, especially as the carnival queen event is set to return after an eight year absence.
