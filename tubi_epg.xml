Second only to Alaska in size, Texas is known as the place where everything is bigger. From big college football games to endless oil fields and vast wind farms, Texas is home to more than 30 million Americans. But the state is about more than just big oil, college football and cattle farms - it's also home to some of the best boating in the country. Boasting a myriad of waterways, boaters here enjoy hundreds of lakes, rivers and streams that provide recreational opportunities, abundant wildlife and plenty of fishing. From Austin Texas to San Antonio host Ryan McVinney and the Boat Trader crew explore the laid-back Texas lake life including boat up restaurants along the Colorado River, watersports in Austin and the history of the waterways throughout the region. Boat manufacturers highlighted in this episode are Tige Boats and ATX Surf Boats, two premium Texas-based wake boat brands known for their high-quality, cutting-edge vessels that come equipped with advanced wake shaping technologies and equipment ideal for water skiing, wake surfing and wakeboarding.

Their investigation introduces Barnaby and Troy to many eccentric and quirky residents and soon turns up a web of sex, blackmail and lies, and the possibility that the murder could be connected to a shooting accident two years ago, which claimed another woman's life.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250420093500 +0000" stop="20250420112000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When wealthy landowner Gregory Lancaster's body goes missing on the night of his death, a sinister web of secrets and lies is exposed in the village of Little Malton.

In a small Ohio community, an elderly woman and a teenage boy disappeared within hours of each other.  Police believed the cases were linked, but didn't know how. They contacted the FBI for help.  A trail of stolen vehicles and murder victims across seven states led agents on a hunt for two suspected killers. Their only hope of stopping them was to anticipate the killers' next move.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250420182400 +0000" stop="20250420192000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In 1997, a series of crimes in a small Iowa farming community left residents reeling in shock and fear. Two young men went on a crime spree of robbery, kidnapping and murder, and then disappeared. By the time they were identified, they already had a twelve-hour lead. As the hunt for the two men expanded, the FBI committed its resources to tracking down the suspects. The pursuit would take agents across six states to catch the killers before they struck again.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250420192000 +0000" stop="20250420201700 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>When a Delaware woman vanished in 1996, family and friends discovered her secret life.  The appointments secretary to the Governor had carried on an illicit affair with a wealthy married man.  Agents suspected that her powerful ex-lover was responsible, but they had little physical evidence to support their theory.  Investigators never found the woman's body or the murder weapon.  The FBI's only hope was to go undercover, and turn brother against brother.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250420201700 +0000" stop="20250420211800 +0000"><title>Los Archivos del FBI (Doblado)</title><desc>El primero de octubre de 1993, un extraño secuestró a Polly Klaas de doce años durante una piyamada en su casa. El FBI de inmediato entró en el caso. Los agentes reunieron fibras de su habitación y descubrieron, a través del uso de fuentes de luz láser, la huella de una palma en la cama de Polly, previamente invisible al ojo humano. Después de una extensa investigación de dos meses, el FBI arrestó a Richard Allen Davis. La impresión de la palma y las fibras coincidieron y Davis fue condenado por secuestro y asesinato.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250420211800 +0000" stop="20250420221200 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>Racial tensions in Buffalo in 1980 were at an all-time high.  Six black males had been brutally murdered--two had their hearts cut out.  The only thing connecting the victims was their ethnicity and the fact that each had been shot with .22 caliber bullets. Residents screamed for the police to stop this serial killer.  With no suspects, local investigators turned to the FBI.  Profilers were able to produce a psychological composite of the type of person the killer would most likely be.  Their analysis paid off.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250420221200 +0000" stop="20250420231100 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In the late 80's, Florida's cocaine imports were among the highest in the nation.
