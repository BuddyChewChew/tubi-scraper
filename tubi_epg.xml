The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250506224200 +0000" stop="20250506233900 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>The guys receive a visit from Emma, who disguises her tattoo equations after an attempt to impress her math teacher; Alice gets her claws into dog-lover William's cover.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250506233900 +0000" stop="20250507003400 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Sketch helps Sian cover a clown tattoo that's scaring the life out of anyone who sees it; Jay has to deal with Emma's extremely intimate cat portrait.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250507003400 +0000" stop="20250507012800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Harry wants a memorial tattoo dedicated to a very intimate body part after surviving testicular cancer; Matt has doodled on his own legs with a tattoo machine.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250507012800 +0000" stop="20250507022300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>The artists cover Zoe's tattoo dedicated to her favourite food, Sean's lewd and lengthy leprechaun that his wife wants rid of.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250507022300 +0000" stop="20250507031900 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>The team help Hayley, whose cheeky tattoo is threatening to derail her wedding plans; Dom's saucy camel is giving him the hump.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250507031900 +0000" stop="20250507042000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's first programme is La Lanterna in Letchworth, Hertfordshire.
