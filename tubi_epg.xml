Two young men went on a crime spree of robbery, kidnapping and murder, and then disappeared. By the time they were identified, they already had a twelve-hour lead. As the hunt for the two men expanded, the FBI committed its resources to tracking down the suspects. The pursuit would take agents across six states to catch the killers before they struck again.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250919132900 +0000" stop="20250919142500 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In Kokomo, Indiana an unthinkable crime terrified residents. A young woman was snatched from her home on a bright spring morning.  Drops of blood and a torn window screen were all that was left to tell authorities what happened to the twenty-one year old victim. After several days of searching, a former FBI profiler narrowed the suspect list to one. Agents and detectives followed the trail across state lines hoping to find the victim before her time ran out.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250919142500 +0000" stop="20250919152400 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In Puerto Rico, the death of a government witness, and the suspicious circumstances surrounding it, lead the FBI and local authorities to suspect corruption in the highest levels of the police force.
