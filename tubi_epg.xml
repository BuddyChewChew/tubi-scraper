While there was evidence he was desperately seeking to avoid bankruptcy, and had visited a local millionaire to get back his money from a scheme he had invested in, a post mortem reveals that he had been murdered. The two detectives soon find their investigations crossing over, when a man found to have an illegal collection of bird eggs, is also murdered, prompting concerns that the millionaire's scheme is being used to defraud many, and that someone is willing to kill to keep the scheme going.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250427185600 +0000" stop="20250427205500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When MATTHEW DRAPER, a quarry worker is killed by a demolition charge after obeying the orders of his foreman, IAN FRASER, to return to the unexploded device, no one can predict how it might effect the tranquil village of Fletcher's Cross nine years later...</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250427205500 +0000" stop="20250427225200 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby's aunt, Alice Bly (Phyllis Calvert), has an addiction to detective stories, a deep admiration for her favourite nephew, and is recovering from an operation at the Lawnside Nursing Home.

Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250427020800 +0000" stop="20250427030500 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>Marie ended up being rushed into hospital when surgery to remove excess skin left her with life threatening sepsis.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250427030500 +0000" stop="20250427040200 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>Sue's 'cut price' tummy tuck in Turkey almost killed her and Oli's quest to become a Korean pop star led him to spend £100,000 to look like his Asian idols.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250427040200 +0000" stop="20250427050000 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>A firsthand account of so-called 'Botox Parties'.

For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250428215500 +0000" stop="20250428225400 +0000"><title>Hoarders SOS (Season 1)</title><desc>The Hoarder SOS team help a man who can’t say
