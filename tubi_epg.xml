This week we are forced to take notice of Demolition Dave, a 49 yr old South Australia man who thanks to some home training smashes the qualifier. For those lucky enough to survive the Fly Screen Sweeper it was Dizzy Dummy time. Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250422195547 +0000" stop="20250422210851 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In the first episode of season 3, Richard Hammond introduces a brand new challenge called Crash Mountain.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250422210851 +0000" stop="20250422222210 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In this episode, twenty intrepid contestants – take on four gruelling, but wildly funny obstacle courses.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250422222210 +0000" stop="20250422233535 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In this episode, twenty intrepid contestants take on four gruelling obstacles.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250422233535 +0000" stop="20250423005048 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>The Qualifier sees the return of an old favourite, the ‘Big Red Balls’.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250423005048 +0000" stop="20250423020356 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Contestants face different games like The Qualifier, The Crash Mountain, Dizzy Dummies and The Wipeout Zone.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250423020356 +0000" stop="20250423031643 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In this episode, the North of the country takes on the South in a battle to win the coveted trophy.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250423031643 +0000" stop="20250423042955 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>The Winter Blob makes a welcome appearance to send the contestants into orbit whilst Granny’s House.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250423042955 +0000" stop="20250423054305 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Tonight, twenty brave battlers will take on the wintry weirdness.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250423054305 +0000" stop="20250423070000 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Twenty brave Brits have volunteered for an expedition to the arctic wastelands of Argentina.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250423070000 +0000" stop="20250423080926 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Richard and co-host Amanda return with new obstacles, new contestants and LOTS of falling in this episode.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250423080926 +0000" stop="20250423090316 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>20 Greatest Hits</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250423090316 +0000" stop="20250423101602 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In this episode, the North of the country takes on the South in a battle to win the coveted trophy.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250423101602 +0000" stop="20250423113126 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Richard Hammond presents the annual Total Wipeout trophy-athon.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250423113126 +0000" stop="20250423124430 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In the first episode of season 3, Richard Hammond introduces a brand new challenge called Crash Mountain.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250423124430 +0000" stop="20250423133856 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>Showdowns don’t come more epic than this.

It is the prime example of HOW NOT TO RUN A RESTAURANT. Owner DAVE is the flakey self-appointed head chef, who hasn't been in a kitchen for 30 years and can't cook. His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from "tomato and cointreau soup" to "pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce". Gordon faces a hellish week, Clubway 41 is breaking every rule in book, can he bring Dave, Dawn and their food back to earth?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250422195600 +0000" stop="20250422205700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Walnut Tree Inn was in big trouble - there was no head chef, the customers had dwindled, and the owner had been forced to sell the family home to keep the business afloat.
Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250422205700 +0000" stop="20250422215800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's program Gordon Ramsay travels to the seaside to help ailing hotel and restaurant, The Sandgate.

La Gondola is stuck in a time-warp with naff Seventies cuisine, bad net curtains and no customers. New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250422225900 +0000" stop="20250423000000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Gordon last left Laurence knowing that he had simplified his menu to have clean, simple, honest, traditional food using local produce.

The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250423205400 +0000" stop="20250423215400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250423215400 +0000" stop="20250423225400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool.
