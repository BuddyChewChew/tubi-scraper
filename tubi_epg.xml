In the next team challenge, the junior home cooks will prepare VIP dishes for a dining room of all grandmothers for their first restaurant challenge.

Back in his old stomping grounds, Josh first meets up with the award-winning chef and Mumbai native, Chintan Pandya, currently blowing up the New York food scene with his unapologetic and authentic Indian cuisine (pro tip: try the goat brains). Next, Josh travels through the boroughs, heads upstate, and along the coast to source local ingredients—from sake brewers and pig farmers to catching fresh lobster just 100 miles from Wall Street. As always the adventure will end with a feast, right back in Chintan’s kitchen.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250511052959 +0000" stop="20250511055957 +0000"><title>Deer and Deer Hunting</title><desc>In Texas, outdoor writer Brad Fenson assesses whether or not the moon phase has an impact on his whitetail hunt where the big bucks seem to be sticking to nighttime movement.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250511055957 +0000" stop="20250511062956 +0000"><title>Deer and Deer Hunting</title><desc>Dan Schmidt struggles with freezing Nebraska temperatures on a whitetail rut hunt in the Sandhills.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250511062956 +0000" stop="20250511065955 +0000"><title>Deer and Deer Hunting</title><desc>Seasoned bowhunter Bob Robb remains humble as he faces a reality that no amount of practicing can ever fully eliminate.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250511065955 +0000" stop="20250511072957 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor meet up with Captain Nick LaBadie at Big Pine Key for an action packed day on the flats chasing tarpon, bonefish and permit for the elusive grand slam.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250511072957 +0000" stop="20250511075956 +0000"><title>TRP</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor run from Hawks Cay Resort up to Islamorada on a windy day to fish under the mangroves for Goliath grouper.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250511075956 +0000" stop="20250511082957 +0000"><title>TRP</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor join Captain Bryson Shaaber to fish the channels around Key West targeting big spring tarpon with live pinfish.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250511082957 +0000" stop="20250511085956 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor launch out of Key Largo and fish their way up a creek filled with monsters.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250511085956 +0000" stop="20250511092956 +0000"><title>The Reel American Road Trip</title><desc>Great views, Food and people.

When Barnaby and Jones start investigating the possible drowning, they discover unsavoury connections to the past that could prove lethal 20 years later, especially when someone attempts to kill.

When a local solicitor is found dead by his assistant and Kinsella's manager, Barnaby attempts to determine what is going on, and soon discover issues with inheritance, affairs, anger, and gambling to make matters difficult. Meanwhile Kinsella's trainer Teddy Molloy (Phil Daniels) has his own hidden agenda. When a re-enactment of a Victorian boxing match gets heated, and Kinsella's manager is found dead in his home's gym, the pair attempt to determine who is responsible, although Barnaby's judgement seems to be clouded on this one.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250510225000 +0000" stop="20250511003500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>A planning dispute turns to murder, after a leading light in the Midsomer Conservation Society suspects her neighbours are involved in a money-making development scam.

The next morning, when Frances Kirby is out for her morning jog, she notices the vintage car they were in up at the airfield, containing Simon Bright's dead body, with Laura nowhere to be seen. Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes. Eventually, the Barnaby family plus Jones make it to a 40s style dance night at the village hall before more villagers start turning up dead.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250511040600 +0000" stop="20250511055400 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When Faith Alexander arrives in Midsomer County to meet her long-lost uncle Rex Masters, she gets a shock - Rex's staff had been told that she was dead. Things become even more complex when Rex's body is found in a nearby river, bearing wounds that suggest he was murdered. Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead. Several people soon come forward with multiple wills, which confuse the matter, but when two more people, close friends of Rex, are also murdered, the investigation raises question on the motive, leading Barnaby to wonder if it was down to finances, passion, or something from Rex's past.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250511055400 +0000" stop="20250511074200 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Following the death of Alan King while on a business trip to China, the family company, King's Crystal, is in financial trouble.

In addition to strife between members of the family, the factory workers are outraged at the loss of their jobs. So when company accountant Peter Baxter is found murdered, Barnaby and Jones suspect a disgruntled employee is to blame.

Barnaby himself is particularly looking forward to seeing recently re-formed rock band, Hired Gun, perform on stage, but he soon gets close to the band for rather unfortunate reasons. During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large. The detectives soon have to delve into a world of rock music, drug use and greed, to find the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250511092900 +0000" stop="20250511111700 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The suspicious death of popular young GP Dr Alan Delaney brings Barnaby and Jones to Midsomer Market to investigate.

Before long, Barnaby and Jones are heading to Wales - former home to Delyth Mostyn, James's fiancee, to delve deeper into the mystery. There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250511111700 +0000" stop="20250511130500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village.

Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder. And once he is replaced on the case, finding the culprit seems less likely than ever, as his replacement is more concerned of an upcoming wedding than the investigation.

There are certainly dark secrets to uncover, and Barnaby has to determine whether the victim's part in a scandal years earlier at Causton police station, is key to the mystery behind his death. It isn't long before he finds that Eddie Marston is attempting blackmail, and soon murdered as a result, and that Lord Holm is in love with Jack's wife, psychotherapist Gina.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250511164200 +0000" stop="20250511182800 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>After a local photographer wins an urban myth competition with his creation of The Wolf Hunter, it unexpectedly gains a cult following.
