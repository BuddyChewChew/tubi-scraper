baggage." How much is acceptable among three contestants in each episode is determined by the "dater," who hears the candidates' intimate secrets and hidden flaws, as well as their attempts to deflect these traits by describing their positive attributes. After two elimination rounds leave one remaining contestant, it's the dater's turn to reveal his or her own baggage ... and then the contestant decides to go forward with the date or not.

P.S. if you're hungry for more Japan content, stay tuned for our next two episodes.In this episode of DIRT, the crew road tripped around Kyushu. The food culture in Kyushu dates back to the emperors of Japan, and the Black Current off the eastern shore has shaped the island's cuisine for centuries. The DIRT team followed that current up the coastline, surfing with new friends and tasting new flavors. And with each stop, we learned even more about how the traditions we keep can honor thousands of years of knowledge—and point the way to the future."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250509160005 +0000" stop="20250509163014 +0000"><title>Silver Kings</title><desc>Capt.

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509112300 +0000" stop="20250509122300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron.

The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509132300 +0000" stop="20250509142000 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>The team needs to remove a derelict yacht from a popular swimming beach in the seaside town of Rockingham.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509142000 +0000" stop="20250509151700 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>The team retrieves a motorbike from an unstable mineshaft and it's a race against the clock to retrieve a vessel in trouble before a massive storm hits.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509151700 +0000" stop="20250509161300 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>The team removes a broken-down tractor from a Caravan Park in trouble with the law; Luke responds to a boat owner in desperate need of help.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509161300 +0000" stop="20250509171000 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>The team struggle to find a landing site after a major pile-up on an urban motorway in Sheffield leaves a woman dead and several other people seriously injured.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509171000 +0000" stop="20250509180700 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>The team fight to save a biker in cardiac arrest after a high speed crash in the Yorkshire Dales and a walker plunges 90ft down a ravine after he slips during a hike.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509180700 +0000" stop="20250509190500 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>A woman is critically injured when a tractor overturns and rolls down a steep hill but flying doctor Tim and paramedic Anthony have a battle on their hands to reach her.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509190500 +0000" stop="20250509200200 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>There’s a head on crash on a moorland road and paramedic Paul must fight to keep a critically injured teenage victim alive in mid-air.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509200200 +0000" stop="20250509210200 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>This week Gordon is at a god-awful Italian restaurant in Derby.

Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509230400 +0000" stop="20250510000300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Sketch meets Billy, whose habit of tattooing himself to impress ladies has got out of hand.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250510000300 +0000" stop="20250510010200 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Sketch removes model Kelly's lower-back tattoo; Alice tackles Laim's DIY tattoo disaster.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250510010200 +0000" stop="20250510020000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Alice paints over Francesca's pitiful Picasso; Sketch gives Madison a memorial to her mum.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250510020000 +0000" stop="20250510025200 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Applegate, Oregon, to try to rescue the failing Applegate River Lodge.
