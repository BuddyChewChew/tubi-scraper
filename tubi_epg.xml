Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250519030000 +0000" stop="20250519033000 +0000"><title>ABC World News Tonight With David Muir</title><desc>The latest news from America, as reported by the ABC television network.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250519033000 +0000" stop="20250519040000 +0000"><title>ABC World News Tonight With David Muir</title><desc>The latest news from America, as reported by the ABC television network.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250519040000 +0000" stop="20250519060000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250519060000 +0000" stop="20250519063000 +0000"><title>ABC World News Now</title><desc>Up-to-date information on current events and news from around the world, airing in the overnight hours.

While there was evidence he was desperately seeking to avoid bankruptcy, and had visited a local millionaire to get back his money from a scheme he had invested in, a post mortem reveals that he had been murdered. The two detectives soon find their investigations crossing over, when a man found to have an illegal collection of bird eggs, is also murdered, prompting concerns that the millionaire's scheme is being used to defraud many, and that someone is willing to kill to keep the scheme going.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250520012800 +0000" stop="20250520032700 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When MATTHEW DRAPER, a quarry worker is killed by a demolition charge after obeying the orders of his foreman, IAN FRASER, to return to the unexploded device, no one can predict how it might effect the tranquil village of Fletcher's Cross nine years later...</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250520032700 +0000" stop="20250520052400 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby's aunt, Alice Bly (Phyllis Calvert), has an addiction to detective stories, a deep admiration for her favourite nephew, and is recovering from an operation at the Lawnside Nursing Home.

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250520224500 +0000" stop="20250520234500
