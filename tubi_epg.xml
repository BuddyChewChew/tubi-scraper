The season began with 24 contestants, but only three young chef-testants are left standing. The challenges this season were more intense, and more inspiring, than ever before. It’s a fight to the finish and only one will take it all home – the trophy, the coveted title of MASTERCHEF JUNIOR and the $100,000 grand prize. Watch the home cooks dish up the best three-course meal of their lives, proving they have what it takes to win.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250418200000 +0000" stop="20250418210000 +0000"><title>Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Chef Ramsay travels to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to visit Hot Potato Cafe.

For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250418190500 +0000" stop="20250418200500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250418200500 +0000" stop="20250418210400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's first programme is Ruby Tates in Brighton, owned and run by ex-actor and failed Hollywood wannabe ALLAN LOVE.
