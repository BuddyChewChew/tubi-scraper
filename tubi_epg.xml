How much is acceptable among three contestants in each episode is determined by the "dater," who hears the candidates' intimate secrets and hidden flaws, as well as their attempts to deflect these traits by describing their positive attributes. After two elimination rounds leave one remaining contestant, it's the dater's turn to reveal his or her own baggage ... and then the contestant decides to go forward with the date or not.

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250508210400 +0000" stop="20250508220600 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's program Gordon Ramsay travels to the seaside to help ailing hotel and restaurant, The Sandgate.

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509112300 +0000" stop="20250509122300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509122300 +0000" stop="20250509132300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue is The Runaway Girl, a tapas bar-cum-nightclub in Sheffield city centre on the brink of collapse. The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509132300 +0000" stop="20250509142000 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>The team needs to remove a derelict yacht from a popular swimming beach in the seaside town of Rockingham.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509142000 +0000" stop="20250509151700 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>The team retrieves a motorbike from an unstable mineshaft and it's a race against the clock to retrieve a vessel in trouble before a massive storm hits.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509151700 +0000" stop="20250509161300 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>The team removes a broken-down tractor from a Caravan Park in trouble with the law; Luke responds to a boat owner in desperate need of help.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509161300 +0000" stop="20250509171000 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>The team struggle to find a landing site after a major pile-up on an urban motorway in Sheffield leaves a woman dead and several other people seriously injured.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509171000 +0000" stop="20250509180700 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>The team fight to save a biker in cardiac arrest after a high speed crash in the Yorkshire Dales and a walker plunges 90ft down a ravine after he slips during a hike.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509180700 +0000" stop="20250509190500 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>A woman is critically injured when a tractor overturns and rolls down a steep hill but flying doctor Tim and paramedic Anthony have a battle on their hands to reach her.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509190500 +0000" stop="20250509200200 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>There’s a head on crash on a moorland road and paramedic Paul must fight to keep a critically injured teenage victim alive in mid-air.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509200200 +0000" stop="20250509210200 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>This week Gordon is at a god-awful Italian restaurant in Derby. La Gondola is stuck in a time-warp with naff Seventies cuisine, bad net curtains and no customers. New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509210200 +0000" stop="20250509220300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Gordon last left Laurence knowing that he had simplified his menu to have clean, simple, honest, traditional food using local produce.

The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250509230400 +0000" stop="20250510000300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Sketch meets Billy, whose habit of tattooing himself
