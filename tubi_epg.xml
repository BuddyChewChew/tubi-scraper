York. City. That’s where our host Josh Rosen kicks off his journey in Episode 4—and where he lived for 16 years and started up the surf-centric apparel brand, Saturdays NYC. Back in his old stomping grounds, Josh first meets up with the award-winning chef and Mumbai native, Chintan Pandya, currently blowing up the New York food scene with his unapologetic and authentic Indian cuisine (pro tip: try the goat brains). Next, Josh travels through the boroughs, heads upstate, and along the coast to source local ingredients—from sake brewers and pig farmers to catching fresh lobster just 100 miles from Wall Street. As always the adventure will end with a feast, right back in Chintan’s kitchen.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250516143237 +0000" stop="20250516150736 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>Hop in the float plane—a new episode of DIRT just dropped.

But when Sonia Woodley is stabbed in the churchyard two years after the death of her abusive husband Gerald, Barnaby and Jones investigate, trying to work out who killed her. It soon becomes clear someone took a pair of tailor scissors to do the deed, but who amongst the villagers could have done so, is unclear, and the investigation is complicated, when the pair learn the local Anglican priest, the parish vicar, had received a letter from Sonia. When he himself is killed, the pair believe something in the letter may be key to solving the mystery.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250516105500 +0000" stop="20250516124000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby is not convinced about Mayor David Hicks' plans to revive an annual trip to Brighton, suspecting his proposal to buy coastal land there, is rather a fraudulent scheme.

The victim was a member of the council who was strange and weird, but someone seemed to have quite a grudge on him, and so Barnaby and Jones delve into his background, and the village, attempting to determine who might have wanted him dead, finding ghosts, grudges, and more beneath the village's surface.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250516161000 +0000" stop="20250516175500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Piano student Zoe Stock has won a place at the Devington Manor Winter School led by internationally renowned musician, Sir Michael Fielding (James Fox).

The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250516034700 +0000" stop="20250516044700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250516044700 +0000" stop="20250516054700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool.

The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele.

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517120300 +0000" stop="20250517130400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517130400 +0000" stop="20250517140000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Stephen aims to see the back of a crude tattoo he had 20 years ago; tattoo-mad ex-solider Rob's phallic self-portrait is a step too far.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517140000 +0000" stop="20250517145500 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>After surviving a fire, Steve has his scarring covered with a Celtic knot design; Amy swaps an embarrassing marriage proposal for a tribute to her favorite dinosaur.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517145500 +0000" stop="20250517155100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Sketch covers a shoddy Egyptian-themed tattoo; Dave is dragged to the studio by his children, who can't bear his obscene back-piece any longer.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517155100 +0000" stop="20250517164800 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage is on a time-critical mission to retrieve a scammed derelict yacht.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517164800 +0000" stop="20250517174400 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage is in flood-ravaged Lismore to help the owners of the town.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517174400 +0000" stop="20250517184100 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage takes on a complex military museum recovery job in the heart of Brisbane.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517184100 +0000" stop="20250517193700 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage is on Stradbroke Island in Queensland to remove a toxic vessel that's threatening to destroy the area's marine life.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517193700 +0000" stop="20250517203800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Gordon last left Laurence knowing that he had simplified his menu to have clean, simple, honest, traditional food using local produce.

The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517213900 +0000" stop="20250517223900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517223900 +0000" stop="20250517233200 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay visits Meson de Mesilla, a “luxury” Tuscan-style hotel in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
