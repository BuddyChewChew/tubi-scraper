Far from being a hobby, the restaurant has taken over his life.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250427220000 +0000" stop="20250427230000 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>S02:E02 - Cambodia</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250427230000 +0000" stop="20250428000000 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>S02:E03 - Malaysia</desc></programme><channel id="685557"><display-name>Jamie Oliver</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/vzcpEKO218Lk8Q==/bb725ad2-1855-4a84-bfa6-a0b7ea8482c4/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjZAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="685557" start="20250426011938 +0000" stop="20250426021212 +0000"><title>Jamie &amp; Jimmy's Food Fight Club</title><desc>Jamie and Jimmy take Harry Hill down memory lane, and then campaign for future doctors.</desc></programme><programme channel="685557" start="20250426021212 +0000" stop="20250426024021 +0000"><title>Jamie's 30 Minute Meals</title><desc>Jamie shows how to cook kinda sausage cassoulet, warm broccoli salad and berry and custard pie.</desc></programme><programme channel="685557" start="20250426024021 +0000" stop="20250426030823 +0000"><title>Jamie's 30 Minute Meals</title><desc>Jamie shows how to make Asian-style salmon, noodle broth, beansprout salad and lychee desert.</desc></programme><programme channel="685557" start="20250426030823 +0000" stop="20250426033644 +0000"><title>Jamie's 30 Minute Meals</title><desc>Jamie makes killer jerk chicken, with rice and beans, refreshing chopped salad and chargrilled corn.</desc></programme><programme channel="685557" start="20250426033644 +0000" stop="20250426040438 +0000"><title>Jamie's 30 Minute Meals</title><desc>Jamie prepares rib eye steak stir fry with dan dan noodles and chilled hibiscus tea.</desc></programme><programme channel="685557" start="20250426040438 +0000" stop="20250426043312 +0000"><title>Oliver's Twist</title><desc>Francesco, Sarah and Andre are Americans studying at University in London.</desc></programme><programme channel="685557" start="20250426043312 +0000" stop="20250426050141 +0000"><title>Oliver's Twist</title><desc>Andy, Louise, Chas and Ollie are all in the London Police Force and mad about spicy food.</desc></programme><programme channel="685557" start="20250426050141 +0000" stop="20250426053010 +0000"><title>Oliver's Twist</title><desc>There’s a myth that models don’t eat fatty foods to keep their figures in trim.</desc></programme><programme channel="685557" start="20250426053010 +0000" stop="20250426055830 +0000"><title>Oliver's Twist</title><desc>Steven and David are bike couriers in London.</desc></programme><programme channel="685557" start="20250426055830 +0000" stop="20250426062703 +0000"><title>Oliver's Twist</title><desc>Jamie has known Stuart and Russell for 5 years and they’re his builders who are renovating his flat.</desc></programme><programme channel="685557" start="20250426062703 +0000" stop="20250426065520 +0000"><title>Oliver's Twist</title><desc>Dom, Jamie’s friend is a magician and a vegetarian.

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250426230700 +0000" stop="20250427000700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250427000700 +0000" stop="20250427010800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue is The Runaway Girl, a tapas bar-cum-nightclub in Sheffield city centre on the brink of collapse. The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250427010800 +0000" stop="20250427020800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point. The restaurant is on its last legs - they've run out of customers, money and hope. Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250427020800 +0000" stop="20250427030500 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>Marie ended up being rushed into hospital when surgery to remove excess skin left her with life threatening sepsis.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250427030500 +0000" stop="20250427040200 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>Sue's 'cut price' tummy tuck in Turkey almost killed her and Oli's quest to become a Korean pop star led him to spend £100,000 to look like his Asian idols.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250427040200 +0000" stop="20250427050000 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>A firsthand account of so-called 'Botox Parties'.
