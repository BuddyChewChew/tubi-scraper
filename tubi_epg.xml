It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away.

The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421014700 +0000" stop="20250421024700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point.

Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421024700 +0000" stop="20250421034300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Norwich City FC supporter Scott and space-loving Dan both took their passions too far with terrible tattoos; Sketch tackles a cover to help transgender Jai feel more feminine.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421034300 +0000" stop="20250421044000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>The guys receive a visit from Emma, who disguises her tattoo equations after an attempt to impress her math teacher; Alice gets her claws into dog-lover William's cover.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421044000 +0000" stop="20250421053600 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Sketch helps Sian cover a clown tattoo that's scaring the life out of anyone who sees it; Jay has to deal with Emma's extremely intimate cat portrait.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421053600 +0000" stop="20250421063000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Harry wants a memorial tattoo dedicated to a very intimate body part after surviving testicular cancer; Matt has doodled on his own legs with a tattoo machine.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421063000 +0000" stop="20250421072500 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>The artists cover Zoe's tattoo dedicated to her favourite food, Sean's lewd and lengthy leprechaun that his wife wants rid of.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421072500 +0000" stop="20250421082500 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Jay saves Luke's bacon with a polished portrait; Sketch beautifies Mark's belly Buddha.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421082500 +0000" stop="20250421092300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Alice tackles Beverley's backside blunder; Jay wipes Bailey's holiday Poomoji tatt clean.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421092300 +0000" stop="20250421102300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>John's tattoo is on another planet, while Alec has made a big mistake with a tiny inking.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421102300 +0000" stop="20250421112300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Jay gives Ian a portrait that has to be seen to be believed and Alice covers Linsey's scar.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421112300 +0000" stop="20250421122100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Belieber Nathan decides it's time for Sketch to rid him of his embarrassing fan tattoo.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421122100 +0000" stop="20250421132100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Sketch meets Billy, whose habit of tattooing himself to impress ladies has got out of hand.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421132100 +0000" stop="20250421141700 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>Skillett's death further troubles the situation in Skeetsmoor Estate.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421141700 +0000" stop="20250421151300 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>Drug dealers complicate the search for a bail-jumper.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421151300 +0000" stop="20250421160900 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>A psychiatrist questions Danny about the Skillett case.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421160900 +0000" stop="20250421170500 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>Fly along with helicopter doctors and paramedics of the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, where cutting-edge modern emergency medicine saves lives every day.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421170500 +0000" stop="20250421180100 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>Fly along with helicopter doctors and paramedics of the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, where cutting-edge modern emergency medicine saves lives every day.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421180100 +0000" stop="20250421185700 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>Fly along with helicopter doctors and paramedics of the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, where cutting-edge modern emergency medicine saves lives every day.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250421185700 +0000" stop="20250421195800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's first programme is La Lanterna in Letchworth, Hertfordshire.
