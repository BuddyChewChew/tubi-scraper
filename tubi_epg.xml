Reed passes on the message, which falls on deaf ears, and chaos ensues.</desc></programme><programme channel="684170" start="20250518220000 +0000" stop="20250519000000 +0000"><title>Black Spurs</title><desc>A bounty hunter (Rory Calhoun) and a saloon queen (Linda Darnell) try to spoil a town, to lure the railroad to another one.</desc></programme><channel id="724210"><display-name>The Rifleman</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/1rK9kyxex79-AQ==/e80bdb91-a817-463c-84b6-f3e4be903428/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjZAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="724210" start="20250517015400 +0000" stop="20250517022600 +0000"><title>The Rifleman</title><desc>In a ghost town, Lucas, Mark and Micah tangle with the Newman family and learn the secret of the town's 20-year-old mystery of a lost gold mine.</desc></programme><programme channel="724210" start="20250517022600 +0000" stop="20250517025800 +0000"><title>The Rifleman</title><desc>Blinded in an explosion, Lucas fights despair as he prepares for a meeting with a gun-toting enemy.</desc></programme><programme channel="724210" start="20250517025800 +0000" stop="20250517033000 +0000"><title>The Rifleman</title><desc>A deranged ex-prisoner of war, cruelly abused in a Northern army prison, captures Lucas, locks him in a cage and vows to make him suffer for his part in the Civil War.</desc></programme><programme channel="724210" start="20250517033000 +0000" stop="20250517040200 +0000"><title>The Rifleman</title><desc>A traveling salesman can't talk his way out of an assault charge.</desc></programme><programme channel="724210" start="20250517040200 +0000" stop="20250517043400 +0000"><title>The Rifleman</title><desc>Lucas is threatened with hanging by a lynch party when some horses he has purchased in a neighboring town turn out to be stolen.</desc></programme><programme channel="724210" start="20250517043400 +0000" stop="20250517050600 +0000"><title>The Rifleman</title><desc>A janitor-turned-gunfighter's reputation hangs on one lucky shot and a lot of gall.

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517120300 +0000" stop="20250517130400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517130400 +0000" stop="20250517140000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Stephen aims to see the back of a crude tattoo he had 20 years ago; tattoo-mad ex-solider Rob's phallic self-portrait is a step too far.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517140000 +0000" stop="20250517145500 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>After surviving a fire, Steve has his scarring covered with a Celtic knot design; Amy swaps an embarrassing marriage proposal for a tribute to her favorite dinosaur.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517145500 +0000" stop="20250517155100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Sketch covers a shoddy Egyptian-themed tattoo; Dave is dragged to the studio by his children, who can't bear his obscene back-piece any longer.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517155100 +0000" stop="20250517164800 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage is on a time-critical mission to retrieve a scammed derelict yacht.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517164800 +0000" stop="20250517174400 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage is in flood-ravaged Lismore to help the owners of the town.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517174400 +0000" stop="20250517184100 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage takes on a complex military museum recovery job in the heart of Brisbane.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517184100 +0000" stop="20250517193700 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage is on Stradbroke Island in Queensland to remove a toxic vessel that's threatening to destroy the area's marine life.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517193700 +0000" stop="20250517203800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Gordon last left Laurence knowing that he had simplified his menu to have clean, simple, honest, traditional food using local produce.

The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517213900 +0000" stop="20250517223900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250517223900 +0000" stop="20250517233200 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay visits Meson de Mesilla, a “luxury” Tuscan-style hotel in Las Cruces, New Mexico.

Shortly before leaving their hotel they mention they haven't been able to find what they're looking for; "something old and derelict that they can do up." Anne Merrick tells them about Winyard, a tumbledown cottage in the woods, might be for sale. At the estate agents they are told the house is not yet available for viewing. Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter. The next morning they are found strangled in their own car. DCI Barnaby starts the investigation with the help of PC Ben Jones and they come across the world of estate agents, identical twins, ghosts, piano wire, and more before another body turns up.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250518080000 +0000" stop="20250518100000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Villagers of Midsomer Barton are all set to celebrate Oak Apple Week, especially as the carnival queen event is set to return after an eight year absence.
