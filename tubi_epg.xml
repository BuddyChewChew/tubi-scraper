It’s all in the name really, an innocent set of stairs, covered in Wipeout Crash cream. Its up the way and down the way for all and sundry. The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris.

A year has passed since Mark conquered the North America Waterfowl Slam. During the off-season, and with Covid just a memory, his focus shifted to thoughts of South America and the waterfowl species that it holds. After a few months of research and talking with the experts at Worldwide Trophy Adventures, he laid out the plan to attempt the South America slam in 2022. With 20 species on the list, Mark is now hunting ducks below the equator as they migrate North to warmer weather. Enjoy this first installment of a 9 episode series that showcases his new quest for another single-season waterfowl slam.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250425040002 +0000" stop="20250425043001 +0000"><title>Chasin' The Sun</title><desc>If you had a blank check to build the best fishing boat possible, what would you create?

After putting on many miles throughout the morning, the fog began to lift and they finally laid eyes on their target buck. Moving into position had its challenges with plenty of satellite deer around, but in the end it came together.

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250426230700 +0000" stop="20250427000700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron.

Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><channel id="715948"><display-name>Family
